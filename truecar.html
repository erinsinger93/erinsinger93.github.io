							<p>At TrueCar, I worked on a team of three to design and build a frontend prototype for a website where car manufacturers can view performance analytics and manage their TrueCar experience. We aimed to combine three TrueCar manufacturer products: TrueCar analytics, brand managment, and campaign management. The provided a huge UI/UX challenge; how could we combine three different products into one, cohesive interface without clutter while still providing a good user experience?</p>
							<p>To answer these questions, we conducted needfinding interviews on a varied audience, made low-fidelity prototypes on whiteboards and pieces of paper, and then iterated onward using Sketch and Photoshop to create medium-fidelity prototypes. Finally, we created our high-fidelity, interactive prototype using Ruby on Rails, CoffeeScript, HTML, and Sass.
							</p>
							<p>Our team's web prototype won the intern award for "Best Overall Execution."</p>

						<img class="img-responsive" src="truecar_login.png" alt="TrueCar Login" />
						<div class="explanation">
							This is the login page. We pulled the image and color scheme from the true.com website because we wanted manufacturers to immediately know upon reaching the site that they were interfacing with a TrueCar product.

				  	<img class="img-responsive" src="truecar_notifications.png" alt="TrueCar Notifications" />
				  	<div class="explanation">
							In our interviews, we found that car manufacturer employees would use our product as a supplementary resource to tools they already have. Resultantly, actionable items need to be easy to find, easy to understand, and easily route to any analytics that prompted the notification.

				  	<img class="img-responsive" src="truecar_datavis1.png" alt="TrueCar Data Visualization 1" />
				  	<div class="explanation">
							We decided to display analytics in an almost story-like fashion. We chose to number any analytics that might answer some preset question, such as national market share, to lead the user to a holistic understanding of the question at hand. We found in our interviews that manufacturers love interacting with maps and are very interested in location-based data.

				  	<div class="explanation">
							We found that people responded positively to colorful graphs with hover features to dig deeper into any data points that seem particularly interesting.

				  	<div class="explanation">
							This is a sample of one of the brand management pages. Within brand management, manufacturers can create their TrueCar "showcases," which are used to advertise their cars to TrueCar customers. Showcases that are in an actionable state, for instance, an unfinished showcase or a showcase that is ready to launch, have either a red or green dot, to symbolize that state.

				  <div>
				  	<img class="img-responsive" src="truecar_brand2.png" alt="TrueCar Brand Management 2" />
				  	<div class="explanation">
							When a manufacturer clicks on a showcase, he or she is taken to the showcase detail page, where more information about the showcase can be viewed. We found that putting a preview or sample of the showcase on the showcase detail page was an effective way of informing users of the current state of a showcase.
